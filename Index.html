	<h2>What is Code Next?</h2>
	<p>	To me, Code Next NYC is a computer science program that gives opportunities to young people. We learn how to code using languages like JavaScript and HTML, how to make our own websites, and many other things to come. The program works to make the technology business more diverse. </p>
	<h2>My Experiences At Code Next NYC</h2>
	<p>	Over the summer, at Foundations, I was first introduced to coding through processing. We recreated emojis and I chose to recreate Pac-Man and the 4 ghosts. It wasn't easy but I used what we learn and I did it.</p>
	<p> In clubs, I learned how to control lights from a terminal, which was Home Automations, and I also learned how to make animations, which was Creative Coding. </p>
	<p> Now in Team Edge, we have learned to control our animations by using pressure sensors. We have also worked on making personal websites and working on making Code Next fan pages like this one. Next, we are going to work on making self-portfolios.</p>
